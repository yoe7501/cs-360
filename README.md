Weight Tracker App – Project Three Submission
For Project Three, I developed a weight tracker app designed to help users easily log and monitor their weight over time. The primary goal was to meet the user need for a simple, quick way to record progress toward health goals. 
The app included a home screen displaying current progress, an input screen for adding weight entries, a history screen for reviewing previous data, and a notification feature that alerts users when they reach their target. 
I designed the user interface to be clean, intuitive, and touch-friendly, using minimal layouts and logical navigation to keep the user experience simple and enjoyable.

When coding the app, I followed a modular, structured approach. I first built the core functionality for basic screens, then added features like notifications and database support in phases. I used version control, clear naming conventions, 
and added comments throughout the code to stay organized. Testing was a regular part of my workflow: after each feature was added, I tested using the Android emulator to make sure everything worked correctly before moving on. 
This incremental testing process was crucial in catching issues early and helped ensure the app's final version was reliable.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring data persistence after the app closed. Researching and implementing a proper local storage solution allowed me to overcome this and greatly improved the app’s reliability. 
I am particularly proud of how the final user interface turned out—it's not only functional but also follows user-centered design principles I learned during this course. Overall, this project strengthened both my technical 
development skills and my ability to design apps with the user’s experience as the top priority.
